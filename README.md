# Best practices
Best practices used in code

## Algemeen
* Comment as much as needed but not more

## HTML
* Always Close Your Tags
* Never Use Inline Styles
* Never Use Inline Javascript. 
* Place all External CSS Files Within the Head Tag
* Keep Your Tag Names Lowercase

## CSS
* Make it readable (Each style gets its own line)
* Organize the stylesheet with a top-down structure
* Create Your HTML First
* Use "margin: 0 auto" to center layouts
* Ems versus Pixels

## JavaScript
* Make your code understandable (Use short clear meaningful names)
* Avoid global variables and objects
* Local variables must be declared with the var keyword. 
* Allow for configuration (Make a configuration object, so maintenance will be easy and allow customization.)
* Use === Comparison (The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison. The === operator forces comparison of values and type.)
* Eval() is evil. (The "eval" function gives us access to JavaScript's compiler. It's risky!)
* Place external scripts at the bottom of the page (When loading a script, the browser can't continue on until the entire file has been loaded.)
* Use {} instead of New Object() (Object literals zijn overzichtelijker dan een constructor object)
* Use [] Instead of New Array() (The rule is simple: when the property names are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object.)
* Always, always use semicolons
* Make use of self-executing functions
* camelCase your function names
* Never End a Definition with a Comma (VB: points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10, ];)
* Declare all variables first
